Implemented Vercel Web Analytics Configuration for Next.js

## Summary
Configured Vercel Web Analytics for the Next.js terminal-portfolio project using the App Router setup.

## Changes Made

### Modified Files:
1. **app/layout.tsx**
   - Updated import from `@vercel/analytics/react` to `@vercel/analytics/next` (the recommended import for Next.js projects)
   - The `<Analytics />` component was already present in the layout (inside the `<body>` tag after `{children}`)

## Implementation Details

### Project Configuration:
- **Router Type**: App Router (app directory structure)
- **Package Manager**: pnpm
- **Analytics Package**: @vercel/analytics ^1.6.1 (already installed)

### Why These Changes:
1. The project already had the @vercel/analytics package installed and the Analytics component added to the root layout
2. Changed the import source from `/react` to `/next` to use the Next.js-optimized version which provides better integration with Next.js features like App Router
3. The component placement inside the `<body>` tag after `{children}` is correct and follows best practices

## Verification

✅ **Build**: `pnpm run build` completed successfully without errors
✅ **Linter**: `pnpm run eslint` passed with no issues
✅ **TypeScript**: Type checking passed during build
✅ **Dependencies**: All dependencies installed correctly with pnpm

## Testing Performed
1. Installed all dependencies using pnpm
2. Ran production build to verify no compilation errors
3. Ran ESLint to ensure code quality
4. Verified TypeScript compilation passed

The Analytics component is now properly configured to track Next.js application usage with the correct import path for App Router projects.
